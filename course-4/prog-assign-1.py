# In this assignment you will implement one or more algorithms for the all-pairs
# shortest-path problem. Here are data files describing three graphs:
# g1.txt g2.txt g3.txt
# The first line indicates the number of vertices and edges, respectively. Each
# subsequent line describes an edge (the first two numbers are its tail and
# head, respectively) and its length (the third number). NOTE: some of the edge
# lengths are negative. NOTE: These graphs may or may not have negative-cost
# cycles. Your task is to compute the "shortest shortest path". Precisely, you
# must first identify which, if any, of the three graphs have no negative
# cycles. For each such graph, you should compute all-pairs shortest paths and
# remember the smallest one (i.e., compute minu,v e Vd(u,v), where d(u,v)d(u,v)
# denotes the shortest-path distance from uu to vv).
# If each of the three graphs has a negative-cost cycle, then enter "NULL" in
# the box below. If exactly one graph has no negative-cost cycles, then enter
# the length of its shortest shortest path in the box below. If two or more of
# the graphs have no negative-cost cycles, then enter the smallest of the
# lengths of their shortest shortest paths in the box below.
# OPTIONAL: You can use whatever algorithm you like to solve this question. If
# you have extra time, try comparing the performance of different all-pairs
# shortest-path algorithms! OPTIONAL: Here is a bigger data set to play with.
# large.txt
# For fun, try computing the shortest shortest path of the graph in the file
# above.
