# In this assignment you will implement one or more algorithms for the 2SAT
# problem. Here are 6 different 2SAT instances:
# 2sat1.txt
# 2sat2.txt
# 2sat3.txt
# 2sat4.txt
# 2sat5.txt
# 2sat6.txt
# The file format is as follows. In each instance, the number of variables and
# the number of clauses is the same, and this number is specified on the first
# line of the file. Each subsequent line specifies a clause via its two
# literals, with a number denoting the variable and a "-" sign denoting logical
# "not". For example, the second line of the first data file is "-16808 75250",
# which indicates the clause -16808âˆ¨75250.
# Your task is to determine which of the 6 instances are satisfiable, and which
# are unsatisfiable. In the box below, enter a 6-bit string, where the ith bit
# should be 1 if the ith instance is satisfiable, and 0 otherwise. For example,
# if you think that the first 3 instances are satisfiable and the last 3 are
# not, then you should enter the string 111000 in the box below.
# DISCUSSION: This assignment is deliberately open-ended, and you can implement
# whichever 2SAT algorithm you want. For example, 2SAT reduces to computing the
# strongly connected components of a suitable graph (with two vertices per
# variable and two directed edges per clause, you should think through the
# details). This might be an especially attractive option for those of you who
# coded up an SCC algorithm in Part 2 of this specialization. Alternatively, you
# can use Papadimitriou's randomized local search algorithm. (The algorithm from
# lecture is probably too slow as stated, so you might want to make one or more
# simple modifications to it --- even if this means breaking the analysis given
# in lecture --- to ensure that it runs in a reasonable amount of time.) A third
# approach is via backtracking. In lecture we mentioned this approach only in
# passing; see Chapter 9 of the Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani book, for
# example, for more details.
