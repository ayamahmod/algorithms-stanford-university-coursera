# The goal of this problem is to implement the "Median Maintenance" algorithm
# (covered in the Week 3 lecture on heap applications). The text file contains a
# list of the integers from 1 to 10000 in unsorted order; you should treat this
# as a stream of numbers, arriving one by one. Letting x_i denote the ith
# number of the file, the kth median m_k, k is defined as the median of the
# numbers x_1,...,x_k. (So, if k is odd, then m_k â€‹is ((k+1)/2)((k+1)/2)th
# smallest number among x_1,...,x_k; if k is even, then m_k is the (k/2)th
# smallest number among x_1,...,x_k.)
# In the box below you should type the sum of these 10000 medians, modulo 10000
# (i.e., only the last 4 digits). That is, you should compute (m_1+m_2+m_3 +
# ...+ m_{10000}) mod 10000.
# OPTIONAL EXERCISE: Compare the performance achieved by heap-based and
# search-tree-based implementations of the algorithm.
